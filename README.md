Computer graphics projects

Project1:  Aims at creating the UWYO logo using the following:
1.	A resolution and sample points of the UWYO logo on the grid. Setup of the coordinate systems to match.
2.	OpenGL primitives to draw the logo with at least 3 different types of primitives. 3. Filled in regions and non-filled in regions.

Project2: The purpose of Project2 is to understand how to use OpenGL transformation functions as well  as understand how the matrices are being computed for those transformations.
 	Contains the following:
1.	Setup of 3D orthographic projection in OpenGL.
2.	Implementation of OpenGL commands for translation, rotation, scale, and reset within the scene when the corresponding key is pressed.
3.	Implementation of keyboard commands for translation, rotation, scale, and reset
4.	Implementation of push and pop for all transformations only using OpenGL commands.
5.	Implementation of the transformations using the matrices and multiplying the matrices.
6.	Implementation of a transformation stack similar to the one used for OpenGL.

Project3: The purpose of project is to understand how shading and ray tracing work and how to incorporate shadows.
Contains the following:
1.	Calculation of the 3d hit point using the hit time found.
2.	Modified phong shading and implementation of the shade function which calculates the total illumination that follows the formulas for the modified shading model.
3.	The implementation to spawn multiple reflection rays
4.	The implementation of the calculation of shadow ray
5.	The implementation of Refraction rays. 

Project4: The purpose of Project4 is to demonstrate understanding of the camera and projection when using raytracing.
Contains the following:
1.	Derivation of U,V, and N, and the camera matrix. Implementation of a roll, pitch, yaw, and slide. 
2.	Usage of Keyboard callbacks for translation/slide, pageup, pagedown, roll, pitch and yaw to make the scene interactive. 
3.	A "double buffering‚Äù implementation to avoid flickering, using pixmaps.
4.	Updation of the initial ray implementation to Orthographic projection when computing the rays.
5.	A keyboard callback to switch between Perspective and Orthographic Projections.

Final Project: 
1. Implemented refractions and total internal reflection in project4
2. Used point light and applying Ambient, diffuse and specular lighting.
3. Used spot and directional lights and applying Ambient, diffuse and specular lighting.
